    "username": <YOUR_DB_LOGIN_NAME>,
    "password": <YOUR_DB_PASSWORD>,
    "database": "Flights_Search_DB_DEV",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  }
}
```

## DB Design
  - Airplane Table
  - Flight
  - Airport
  - City 

  - A flight belongs to an airplane but one airplane can be used in multiple flights
  - A city has many airports but one airport belongs to a city
  - One airport can have many flights, but a flight belongs to one airport


  
## Tables

### City -> id, name, created_at, updated_at
### Airport -> id, name, address, city_id, created_at, updated_at
    Relationship -> City has many airports and Airport belongs to a city (one to many)
```

- npx sequelize model:generate --name Airport --attributes name:String,address:String,cityId:integer
